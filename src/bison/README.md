Almost each rule map to one class and all its construct element as class member
Sometimes may use inheritance or sth else

issues:
expression rule doesn't support function call, which means assign function ret val not allowed (-_-)

val a: integer;
val b: boolean;
not allowed

instead:

val a: integer;
	b: boolean;

Parameters seperated by ; not ,
